    <p>SOME BUILT IN ONBJECTS ARE: 1.JSON <br>2. Local storage <br>3.Math <br> 4. console</p>
    <p>JOSN: It is understood by other languages also(php,python,JAVA).it is a built-in object that stands for javascript object Notation similar to javascript objects but cannot have function.<br> object to JSON=> stringify(obj)<br>JSON to object => parse(str)
        <hr></p>
        <p>THE OBJECT ARE ACTUALLY REFERENCES (similar to pointers in C++ )<br>Equality Checks:

            Equality comparisons between object variables in JavaScript are based on their references, not their content (similar to comparing pointers in C++).<hr>
        </p><p>Autoboxing is the automatic conversion that the Java compiler makes between the primitive types and their corresponding object wrapper classes. Eg  autoboxing a string  to get properties like length and toUpperCase.<hr><p>In JavaScript, null and undefined are two distinct types that represent different values. By definition, undefined means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value, whereas null is an assignment value, meaning that a variable has been declared and given the value of null .
